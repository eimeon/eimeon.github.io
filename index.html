                                During the second week, I pushed further the idea of the previous week to create an outfit for a festival.
                                I spend time sketching different ideas. I was really inspired by the butterfly which represents a colorful but peaceful beauty of nature.
                                In addition, I thought about the modulable part of the design and printed the first prototype of a module.

                                        After numerous sketches, I settled for the design that can be seen in the picture.

                                        The next step was about finding an idea of how the texture of the design should be.
                                        I would like the texture to be small flowers with eventually butterfly on tops. However there is one constraint.
                                        As this design is made to be wearable, the small modules can not have sharp angles in direct contact of the skin.

                                        With the constraint of having no sharp angles in mind, I thought of multiple options.
                                        I wanted to keep the idea of tiny flowers intermodulable but binding them together with no extra element seemed impossible.
                                        However, it was possible to bind them with disks.
                                        The idea is that each disk will bind three modules together.

                                        Step 3 was about creating a viable 3D-design for the modular part.
                                        For this part, I used the software Shapr3D, which is an intuitive 3D modelisation software made to make the design of 3D object for printing easier.
                                        I created this snowflake like shape based on the previous sketch of the modular element, as well as a disks with a small slot to try inserting the snowflake in.
                                        Here the height of the snowflake is 0.50mm to assure that it stays as bendable as possible.

                                        Here is a picture of the actual 3D print of the module. I printed with 2 layers of 0.30mm to save time even thought my model was 0.50mm.
                                        For that reason, the print of the disk, and more precisely the slot of the disk did not succeed.
                                        For next week, I want to test different heights for the snowflake and the disk and different slicing.

                                This project also serves as an inspiration for this class as I had to print 3D models and created a butterfly-shaped robot.

                                        Soft Butterfly is a robot designed to help conscious breathing. Made out of paper-mÃ¢chÃ©, it is light up from the inside.
                                        The audience wears a band that allows sensor to detect their breathing in and out.
                                        Using Arduino and Servo motors, the butterfly flaps its wings in synchrony with the audience's breathing pattern.
                                        Guided meditation audio helps the audience to breathe more consciously.

After spending sick days watching the Queen's Gambit, 'I was really inspired by vintage dresses design. As for the modules, I was inspired by the artist "sewprinted" on Instagram, and in particular this <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Ck8j6YvACas/">dress</a> she made.</p>

                            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">
                                Week 6 was very intense. I spend 5 out of 5 days at the Fablab and printed in total around 10 batches. I assembled them and as I saw the growing number of students arriving to the Fablab to use the printers, I realised I will not be able to finish this project.
                                However, I stayed motivated and stayed there as much as I could. My plan was to start from the middle of the skirt and work down from there as the details are the endings. As I realised that I will not be able to finish even that,
                                I thought about printing only the front of the dress. As of the end of week 6, I highly doubt even this will be possible. Indeed, there are only 2 available printers for around 20 students.
                                Because of the creative design exhibition, and two strike days in a row, we lost 3 out of the 6 classes. So this week, there is always at least 10 different people in the Fablab with 1h print each.
                                With 2 printers, there is around a 5 hour waiting time for each print. In my case, a print covers a small surface of 10x5cm. Rare are the days where I can start 2 prints.

My phone camera broke a few days before and I was the only one left on the Fablab on Friday at 8:30pm, so the image is not of the best quality, but it shoes the state of the project at this moment of time.

                                        During a party on a week end, I met with a make-up artist friend. I asked her to model the dress before knowing the dress would not be finished.
                                        I also had in mind to ask my roomate to take pictures with his analog camera to stay in the vintage vibe. All of these ideas wame before I knew the project would not be done.
                                        As of now, I cancelled everything and will model the small patch of the dress on me and on campus, with a normal iPhone camera.

                                        I was working in front of the ENS building as people started to go outside to eat lunch. I continued assembling for multiple hours in the company of ENS students.
                                        After assembling the bigger pieces, I had trouble with positioning the smaller ones. As I had only a limited amount of the smaller pieces (42), I needed to calculate exactly how many I could put.
                                        I had enough to fit bigger 22 pieces on the last row. It should have been 23 but the last piece broke. I decided to do one row of 22 thiner pieces and then patches of 4 thiner pieces to give a spiky effect at the end of the skirt.
